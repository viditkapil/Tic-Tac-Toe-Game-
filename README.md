# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Programing language : Python 3 

A tic tac toe game was designed for two players asking them first to choose their marks (‘X’ or ‘O’) and then with the help of random function program decides who would go first. After a player chooses a no in range (1-9) it marks their marker and display the board on screen and internally check for win or tie and if no one seems to an option it gives a chance to player two and same thing happens again and again until a tie or win situation doesn’t arise.
